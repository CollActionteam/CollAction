                "text" : "The term Crowdacting, as it is used here, is a term that has been introduced by CollAction. Basically, it means: ‘taking action collectively and conditionally with the purpose of achieving positive impact on the world and its inhabitants’. Simply put, with crowdacting we ask: ‘Would you take action if you knew that a hundred \/ a thousand\/ a million\/ a billion others would do so too?’ An example of a crowdacting project: ‘If we can find 10,000 people that commit to switch to renewable energy if 9,999 others would do the same, we will all switch together’. As a result, we form a critical mass of people that has a huge impact on making this world a better place. The concept is very similar to crowdfunding, but people commit to actions, instead of money.<br />In practice, a crowdacting project follows three steps:<br /><br />1. The ProjectStarter launches a project on collaction.org. He/she proposes a certain action (for example switching to renewable energy), a target (minimum number of participants), and a deadline.<br />2. ProjectSupporters commit to taking action, if the target is met within the deadline.<br />3. If and when the target is met, everybody acts collectively.<br />More information can be found on [www.crowdacting.org](https://www.crowdacting.org)."

                "text" : "Although the term crowdacting in its current meaning is new, the underlying concept is not. There are plenty of other examples of collective actions that contain elements of crowdacting. Think for instance of boycotts, demonstrations, collective bargaining initiatives, or petition websites. The difference is the fact that crowdacting combines three elements: 1) It’s (explicitly) conditional (it only happens if a set target is met); 2) it’s for social and/or ecological good; and 3) the action goes beyond signing a petition. More information on how crowdacting resembles and differs from other initiatives can be found on [www.crowdacting.org](https://www.crowdacting.org)."
