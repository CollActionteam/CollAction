                    Setting the right target for your project is not easy. It depends on a number of different factors,
                    for instance: what type of project is it? What is the action that is proposed (is it hard or difficult)?
                    How much time do you have to promote the project? Do you have an existing network that you can mobilize?
                </p>
                <p>
                    In general, we say: it's better to set a more conservative target and far exceed it, than setting a
                    very ambitious target and not reach it by a few percent. If you want to know what a good target would
                    be for your project, a good start would be to think about your communication plan: what are you planning
                    to do to reach people? How many people can you reach through each channel that you are planning to use
                    (e.g. through your personal network, social media groups, partnering with other organizations/media)?
                    Also, please feel free to browse the projects that have already on the Find Project page, or reach out
                    to <a href="mailto:collactionteam@gmail.com">collactionteam@gmail.com</a> - we're happy to help you
                    think about this!

                    A project can only be listed when it meets the following criteria:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The goal of the project is to make a positive societal or ecological contribution to your neighbourhood, country or the world.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The project is not geared towards personal gain.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The project does not include activities that are focussed on conversion or activism (religious or political).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The project does not include activities that are illegal or do not abide by the official legislation of the Netherlands or the country of implementation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The online project registration form is completed fully and truthfully and has a clear and easily readable project description and goal. The CollAction team can ask for clarification and/or edit your text if necessary.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The ProjectStarter has thought through how people can be moved from commitment to action. We can help you with this!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The project is ambitious but realistic â€“ the CollAction evaluation commission judges if this is the case. The ProjectStarter can activate his/her own network, and/or has a good plan to achieve the target.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The ProjectStarter commits to measuring the impact of the action (e.g. the number of people that have acted as a result of the project) and to sharing this information with CollAction.
