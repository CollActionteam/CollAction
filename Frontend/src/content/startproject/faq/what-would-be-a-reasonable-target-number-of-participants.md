Setting the right target for your project is not easy. It depends on a number of different factors, for instance: what type of project is it? What is the action that is proposed (is it hard or difficult)? How much time do you have to promote the project? Do you have an existing network that you can mobilize?

In general, we say: it's better to set a more conservative target and far exceed it, than setting a very ambitious target and not reach it by a few percent. If you want to know what a good target would be for your project, a good start would be to think about your communication plan: what are you planning to do to reach people? How many people can you reach through each channel that you are planning to use (e.g. through your personal network, social media groups, partnering with other organizations/media)? Also, please feel free to browse the projects that have already on the Find Project page, or reach out to <mailto:collactionteam@gmail.com> - we're happy to help you think about this!
