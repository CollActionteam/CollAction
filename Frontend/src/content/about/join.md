  CollAction is always looking for fun people who want to make a difference by
  making CollAction the next big thing! Please note that these are all volunteer
  positions for now (all current team members are volunteers as well :) )


  We’re looking for:


  * Communications guru: As the communications guru you are responsible for
  developing and implementing our communications strategy and further build the
  growing CollAction community. For those who need a good excuse to spend all
  day on Facebook. [Email](mailto:collactionteam@gmail.com) us for more info!

  * Project Starter: Do you sometimes think ‘AAAH THE WORLD IS ON FIRE, I NEED
  TO DO SOMETHING BUT WHAT!?’. Well, maybe chill out first and have some herbal
  tea :). Then get your hands dirty and [start a project here](/projects/start).
