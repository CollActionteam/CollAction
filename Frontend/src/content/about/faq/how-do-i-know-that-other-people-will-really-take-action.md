You can never be 100% sure. In the first place, crowdacting is about trust. Trusting that people want to work together to create a better world. Trusting that people are attached to their personal ideals. And trusting that people will keep their promises. We hope to build a community of people that take their commitments seriously and try to create a culture in which agreement=agreement.

That being said, we will incorporate certain processes and tools to ensure that as many project supporters proceed to taking action. What these processes are depends on the type of project. For some projects (such as switching projects, for example to a fair bank or green energy) the action can already be started conditionally at the time of commitment. When the target is reached, supporters of the project will automatically be transferred to the fair bank or renewable energy provider. When it comes to local projects, social control will play a bigger role. Other projects might be purely based on trust. We will be testing different tools and approaches in the upcoming projects. We ask ProjectStarters to seriously consider this question â€“ the team of CollAction can help you think this through!
