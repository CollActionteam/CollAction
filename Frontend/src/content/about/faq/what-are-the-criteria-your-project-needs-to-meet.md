A project can only be listed when it meets the following criteria:

* The goal of the project is to make a positive societal or ecological contribution to your neighbourhood, country or the world.
* The project is not geared towards personal gain.
* The project does not include activities that are focussed on conversion or activism (religious or political).
* The project does not include activities that are illegal or do not abide by the official legislation of the Netherlands or the country of implementation.
* The online project registration form is completed fully and truthfully and has a clear and easily readable project description and goal. The CollAction team can ask for clarification and/or edit your text if necessary.
* The ProjectStarter has thought through how people can be moved from commitment to action. We can help you with this!
* The project is ambitious but realistic - The CollAction evaluation commission judges if this is the case. The ProjectStarter can activate his/her own network, and/or has a good plan to achieve the target.
* The ProjectStarter commits to measuring the impact of the action (e.g. the number of people that have acted as a result of the project) and to sharing this information with CollAction.
