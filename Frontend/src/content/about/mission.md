> We help people solve collective action problems through crowdacting

Many things are going well in the world. But we’re also facing some large and urgent problems. We see that traditional solutions to these problems are just not enough. At the same time there are so many people that want to do something to create a better world. That’s why we came up with a new approach: crowdacting. With crowdacting we ask: “Would you take action if a \hundred/thousand/million] other people would do the same?”
