  > We help people solve collective action problems through crowdacting


  Many things are going well in the world. But we’re also facing some large and
  urgent problems. We see that traditional solutions to these problems are just
  not enough. At the same time there are so many people that want to do
  something to create a better world. That’s why we came up with a new approach:
  crowdacting. With crowdacting we ask: “Would you take action if a
  \[hundred/thousand/million] other people would do the same?”

  ## About collAction


  Do you sometimes have the feeling that your actions are only a drop in the
  ocean? Well, not anymore, because we are introducing crowdacting: taking
  action knowing that you are one of many. We revamp the neighbourhood with a
  hundred people or switch to renewable energy with hundreds or thousands of
  people at the same time. Find out more about what crowdacting is in the video
  or the FAQs, take action collectively with one of the [existing
  projects](/projects/find), or [start your own crowdacting
  project](/projects/start).
